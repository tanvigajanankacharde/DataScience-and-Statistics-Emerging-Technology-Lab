# 📊 Data Science & Machine Learning Lab

Welcome to the **Data Science & Statistics Lab** 🎓
This repository is all about **learning by doing** — it includes practical notebooks that cover the basics of **data science, statistics, and machine learning** using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebooks**.

---

## 💡 What’s Inside

Here you’ll find step-by-step practicals that teach you how to:

* 🧩 Collect and clean data
* 📊 Explore and visualize data
* 📈 Understand basic statistics
* 🤖 Build simple machine learning models

Each practical is written as a **Jupyter Notebook** so you can **run the code, see the results, and learn by experimenting!**

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

We’ll use popular Python libraries for data science:

| Library                     | Purpose                          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 🐼 **pandas**               | Handle and analyze data          |
| 🔢 **NumPy**                | Do math and number operations    |
| 📊 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** | Make beautiful charts and graphs |
| 🤖 **Scikit-learn**         | Build and test ML models         |
| 📘 **Jupyter Notebook**     | Write and run code interactively |

## ⚙️ Requirements

Before starting, make sure you have:

* Python 3.8 or above
* Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
* The following libraries installed:

  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
  ```

## 🧠 Practicals List

Each practical is a notebook that teaches one key concept:

1. 📥 **Data Acquisition** – Import and explore data using pandas
2. 📏 **Central Tendency** – Mean, Median, and Mode in datasets
3. 🧮 **DataFrames Basics** – Create, slice, and merge data tables
4. 🧹 **Missing Values** – Detect and fill missing data
5. 🔢 **NumPy Arrays** – Create and manipulate arrays efficiently
6. 📊 **Data Visualization** – Plot data with Matplotlib and Seaborn
7. 📈 **Linear Regression** – Predict numbers using ML
8. ⚡ **Logistic Regression** – Classify data into categories
9. 👥 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Predict based on similar examples
10. 🧱 **Decision Tree** – Learn decision-making using trees
11. 🌲 **Random Forest** – Use many trees for better predictions
12. 💫 **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** – Separate data with boundaries

👉 Once you add your notebooks, place them inside a `notebooks/` folder (e.g., `notebooks/01-data-acquisition.ipynb`).
